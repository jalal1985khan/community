            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            The COVID-19 pandemic has enabled the Catalyst Group to build a strong and dynamic pan-India multidisciplinary network with a variety of expertise. This presents the potential to build the resilience of the vulnerable and their institutions in their everyday emergencies and to be ready for future humanitarian crises (climate & health). This has led to the #COVIDActionCollab transitioning to Community Action Collab, a ‘spring to action’ ready humanitarian emergency platform.
            </p>
            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            Our approach is born of the learning from #COVIDActionCollab is focused on orchestrating the responses of partners, solving difficult problems to find scalable solutions and influencing practice, policy and investments.
            </p>
            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            We deploy a three-pronged approach to support and enable vulnerable communities to survive and thrive amidst a crisis.

    <h2 className="t-vision fs-2">Focus and Scale</h2>
            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            We place vulnerable people at the centre of the initiative. Its strategies and approach are geared towards attaining scale. Its action orientation is etched within what it will seek to do (orchestrate, solve and influence) and how (partner action platform, district-level initiatives and emergency response systems).
            </p>
            <h2 className="t-vision fs-2">Our Unique Approach</h2>
            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            As an orchestrator, we will support the development of nodes of geographical, domain and vulnerable population profiles. Each node would be a cluster of partners, driven by an anchor partner. The node would identify and implement an agenda with respect to the resilience of vulnerable populations in their geographies, with respect to a domain or a vulnerability profile. Through the orchestration, the entire system of nodes will be supported to enable a network effect as a force multiplier. A technology backbone will enable optimal network engagements.
            </p>
            <h2 className="t-vision fs-2">Decentralisation and Localisation</h2>
            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            An integrated district approach for resilience building and disaster preparation will be undertaken for districts selected based on vulnerability assessment and partner availability. This approach would include SDG planning at the district level, scaleable models and initiatives, as well as response plans with the government for disaster management. Localisation will also give a fillip to resilience, which will get comprehensively addressed through building individual as well as collective agency.
            </p>
            <h2 className="t-vision fs-2">Management Architecture</h2>
            <p className="p-vision fs-5 fw-light">
            The backbone of the Community Action Collab is a Secretariat that will help in developing the collaborative platform, maintaining partner nodes, facilitating an impact canvas for problem-solving, designing resilience-building initiatives at the district level and performing other enabler functions for the collaborative like technology, communications, monitoring and evaluation, policy advocacy and governance.
